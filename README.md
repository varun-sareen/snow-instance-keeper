**Automatically keeps your ServiceNow Developer Instance alive so it never gets reclaimed.**

ServiceNow reclaims inactive developer instances after **10 days of no activity**. This tool logs into your instance every day via GitHub Actions (completely free), visits key pages, and keeps it active — all without touching your laptop or phone.

You also get a **daily email notification** telling you whether the job succeeded or failed.

## 🎯 What It Does

Every day, this automation will:

1. Open your ServiceNow developer instance
2. Wake it up if it's hibernating (instances sleep after a few hours of inactivity)
3. Log in with your credentials
4. Visit the **Update Sets** page
5. Visit the **Homepage** to register activity
6. Send you an **email notification** with the result (success or failure)

All of this runs on GitHub's servers — **not your computer**. You set it up once and forget about it.

## 💡 Want to Add More Pages?

Open `scripts/keep-alive.js` and look for "Step 4". Copy that pattern to add more pages:

```javascript
// Example: Also visit Incident list
log("📋 Opening Incidents...");
await page.goto(`${baseUrl}/incident_list.do`, {
  waitUntil: "networkidle",
  timeout: 30000,
});
await sleep(3000);
```

## 💰 Cost

**Completely free.** GitHub Actions gives you 2,000 minutes/month on the free tier. This workflow uses about 5-10 minutes per run, so roughly 150-300 minutes/month — well within the free limit.

**Built with ❤️ to save ServiceNow developers from losing their instances.**
